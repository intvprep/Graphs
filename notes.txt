Minimum Spanning Tree
	- Graph with the minimum number of edges necessary to connect the vertices
	- There are many possible minimum spanning trees for a given set of vertices
	- Number of edges E in a minimum spanning tree is always one less than the 
	  number of vertices V:
			E = V – 1
	- The algorithm for creating the minimum spanning tree is almost identical to that
	  used for searching. It can be based on either the depth-first search or the
	  breadth-first search
